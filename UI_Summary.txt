UI Summary

The user interface is implemented with the following frameworks:
  1. Bootstrap to increase responsiveness of the UI
  2. ApexCharts to display the data in an effective manner
  
The idea for the front-end:
  1. The user will be greeted by a selection menu where they can select which graph they want to view. Once the user clicks on their desired graph, the graph is displayed to the page. Our front-end will allow for dynamic and quick accessing of the data from the database becasue the data needs to only be delivered in an array format to be displayed in a graph. Therefore, JSON will likely be used so that this format can be accomplished.
